This App is based on Algorithm of Sieve Of Eratosthnes which has following functions:
1. Find all the prime number between selected range (Display prime number button)
2. Find nth prime number between selected range  (Find it button)
3. Check if the number is prime number (Check button)
4. Display all the number: prime number and non prime number has different color
5. Display all number from 2 to your upper bound choice and color them depend on their smallest factors
7. A game help to learn prime number -- the game is inspired by "Paino Tile"


Further Improvement:
1. The game part still have space to improve. It is kind of confused since the change of row are not obvious. The movement need 
to be more smooth.
2. There can be more creative way to display the number. 
3. User Interface need to be improved.
